### SqlforPartialUpdate

Format the given data into a specific form to update the database. 

Parameters:

1) dataToUpdate: columns that you want to update. (JSON object)

2) jsToSQL: it is an object that changes the name of the key(s) in the dataToUpdate object with its corresponding value(s) if there are any matching keys. (JS uses camel Case to name variables, on the other hand, the naming convention of SQL is using â€œ_".) 

Returns:

The function returns an object with two keys:
 1) "setCols": column(s) to be updated.
 2) "values": values of the updated fields.'

Example:

const dataToUpdate={"firstName": 'Aliya', "age": 32}
const jsToSQL={firstName:"first_name"}

sqlForPartialUpdate(dataToUpdate,jsToSQL)
>> { setCols: '"first_name"=$1, "age"=$2', values: [ 'Aliya', 32 ] }

sqlForPartialUpdate({},jsToSQL)
>> throws Bad Request Error: No Data
